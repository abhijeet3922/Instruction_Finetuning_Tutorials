    "In this notebook, you will fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization. You will use the [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text out of the box. To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Then you will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics."

    "### 2.4 - Evaluate the Model Quantitatively (with ROUGE Metric)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [ROUGE metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROUGE_(metric)) helps quantify the validity of summarizations produced by models. It compares summarizations to a \"baseline\" summary which is usually created by a human. While not perfect, it does indicate the overall increase in summarization effectiveness that we have accomplished by fine-tuning."

    "## 3 - Perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's perform **Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** fine-tuning as opposed to \"full fine-tuning\" as you did above. PEFT is a form of instruction fine-tuning that is much more efficient than full fine-tuning - with comparable evaluation results as you will see soon. \n",
    "\n",
    "PEFT is a generic term that includes **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (which is NOT THE SAME as prompt engineering!). In most cases, when someone says PEFT, they typically mean LoRA. LoRA, at a very high level, allows the user to fine-tune their model using fewer compute resources (in some cases, a single GPU). After fine-tuning for a specific task, use case, or tenant with LoRA, the result is that the original LLM remains unchanged and a newly-trained “LoRA adapter” emerges. This LoRA adapter is much, much smaller than the original LLM - on the order of a single-digit % of the original LLM size (MBs vs GBs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, at inference time, the LoRA adapter needs to be reunited and combined with its original LLM to serve the inference request.  The benefit, however, is that many LoRA adapters can re-use the original LLM which reduces overall memory requirements when serving multiple tasks and use cases."
