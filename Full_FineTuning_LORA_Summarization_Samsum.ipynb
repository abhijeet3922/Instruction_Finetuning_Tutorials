    "In this notebook, you will fine-tune an existing LLM from Hugging Face for enhanced dialogue summarization. You will use the [FLAN-T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5) model, which provides a high quality instruction tuned model and can summarize text out of the box. To improve the inferences, you will explore a full fine-tuning approach and evaluate the results with ROUGE metrics. Then you will perform Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), evaluate the resulting model and see that the benefits of PEFT outweigh the slightly-lower performance metrics."

    "The [SAMSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/samsum) dataset contains about 16k messenger-like conversations with summaries. Conversations were created and written down by linguists fluent in English. Linguists were asked to create conversations similar to those they write on a daily basis, reflecting the proportion of topics of their real-life messenger convesations. The style and register are diversified - conversations could be informal, semi-formal or formal, they may contain slang words, emoticons and typos. Then, the conversations were annotated with summaries. It was assumed that summaries should be a concise brief of what people talked about in the conversation in third person. The SAMSum dataset was prepared by Samsung R&D Institute Poland and is distributed for research purposes (non-commercial licence: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)."

    "PEFT is a generic term that includes **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and prompt tuning (which is NOT THE SAME as prompt engineering!). In most cases, when someone says PEFT, they typically mean LoRA. LoRA, at a very high level, allows the user to fine-tune their model using fewer compute resources (in some cases, a single GPU). After fine-tuning for a specific task, use case, or tenant with LoRA, the result is that the original LLM remains unchanged and a newly-trained “LoRA adapter” emerges. This LoRA adapter is much, much smaller than the original LLM - on the order of a single-digit % of the original LLM size (MBs vs GBs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, at inference time, the LoRA adapter needs to be reunited and combined with its original LLM to serve the inference request.  The benefit, however, is that many LoRA adapters can re-use the original LLM which reduces overall memory requirements when serving multiple tasks and use cases."
